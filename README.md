# dataStructures-in-C
This repository contains some data structures that can work with any kind of primitive data by the use of void pointers.

STACK:
This data structure contains functions to push, pop, check emptiness in data, delete data structure from data nodes to the stack node itself and contains parameters as size. 
The previously stated content makes it a simple and effective stack.

QUEUE:
This structure contains functions to poll and offer elements to a queue, as well as using support functions to get the number of nodes that are linked together, deleting the whole structure or simply knowing if it is empty or not.

SINGLY LINKED LIST
This data structure was designed (as the theory says) to simulate a simple array. With the advantage of variable size but the problem of using a lot more memory. The functions that were dsigned have the puropse of giving acccesibility an precision, staring simple as navigating by indexes and growing in complexity and precision by the use of comparison functions that are received as a parameter in certain functions.

DOUBLY LINKED LIST
This data structure is not very different from the singly linked list, but even though it takes a lot more space for every node, it is easier to understand and to modify.
