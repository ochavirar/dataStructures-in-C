# dataStructures-in-C
This repository contains some data structures that can work with any kind of primitive data by the use of void pointers.

STACK:
This data structure contains functions to push, pop, check emptiness in data, delete data structure from data nodes to the stack node itself and contains parameters as size. 
The previously stated content makes it a simple and effective stack.

QUEUE:
This structure contains functions to poll and offer elements to a queue, as well as using support functions to get the number of nodes that are linked together, deleting the whole structure or simply knowing if it is empty or not.
